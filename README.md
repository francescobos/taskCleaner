# taskCleaner

My prototype for manage daily family task without stress

## Why

There are recurring tasks, like cleaning the dishwasher, that have to be done regularly but not rigorously and I can do it, but so can my wife.

Have a very easy, smartphone-friendly system that tells you which tasks need to be done ‘as soon as you can’ and with a tap reschedules the task after the necessary time.

No more than three per view

A "smart" system will weight the most important ones at that moment. And that's a nice game :)

## Add my personal task

Add personal tasks related to a place (office, home...) or a market place (tigotà, chinese mega shop!). Like backup data & reschedule.

Add multi-user so my wife can add her tasks too
